    <h2>What even is Fr1zeen?</h2>
    <p>Fr1zeen is a newly-discovered exploit that can unenroll an enterprise enrolled chromebook. This exploit uses RMA shims, which is only intended for use by manufacturers and repair shops, but were leaked. By using this exploit, we can boot into developer mode, enter recovery and boot off of the shim USB like it was a recovery image. Since Google left a rootfs vulnerability unpatched, we were able to run unsigned code; and therefore unenrollment.

      <h2>Okay, so, how did you find Fr1zeen?</h2>
      <p>Even though Google has patched unenrollment, the new exploit was discovered by a group of ethical hackers during a routine security audit of school Chromebooks. The hackers identified a vulnerability in the update-engine that could be exploited to remove enterprise enrollment, leading to the creation of the exploit. The exploit uses RMA shims to manipulate update-engine to allow for unenrollment when rebooting back into ChromeOS.

      <h2>Notes:</h2>
      <p>
        We are still experimenting with the exploit and testing it for bugs. Yes, this does work on devices with a TI50 chip.
